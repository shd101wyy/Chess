To manually test the chess game.

1, try to move all different types of pieces, see if their possible move coordinates are correct.

2, try capture opponentâ€™s piece, see if that works fine.

3, try to make checkmate, and see if the game over dialog show up.

4, try to make stalemate, and see if the game over dialog show up.

5, test whether we can make a suicide move (the move that will kill our king).
